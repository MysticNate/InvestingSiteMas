                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    A: Stocks represent ownership in a company, while bonds
                    represent a loan to a company or government. Stocks offer
                    potential for higher returns but also come with higher risk,
                    while bonds are generally considered safer but offer lower
                    returns.

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    A: Diversification is the practice of spreading your
                    investments across different assets to reduce risk. It's
                    important because it helps protect your portfolio from the
                    impact of a single investment performing poorly.

                    A: Dividends are payments made by a company to its
                    shareholders, usually out of its profits. They are a way for
                    companies to share their success with shareholders and are
                    often seen as a sign of financial health.
